Yikes this day fucking sucked.Â 



Day started like any other day..... lol thatâ€™s too mysterious of an openingÂ 



We woke up said goodbye to Doug and rich as they speed away on their bikes. We got a late start... I mean I got a normal start while sandwich and ramblin got a late start. We hiked together for the morning was really nice and peaceful, I enjoyed the company..... then we got to the Joshua tree for snack/lunch time. My stomach started to feel not great I was farting more than normal? My trail fam would say it was a Normal amount of farts coming from me (I fart a lot out here idk why) but itâ€™s my body I can describe it how I want!



Went to a bush to make myself throw up hopping that would be the end of it..... how foolish!



We made it maybe a mile when the others started to feel real shity. We were hoping it was just the beginning of heat stroke and if we stopped for a few hours waited for it to cool we be good to goÂ ðŸ˜ŽÂ WRONGÂ ðŸ¥¸Â ramblin started vomiting I started have that same flow but the other direction THE sand Witch was stoic and tried to not show how bad she felt but she was extra quiet. It wasnâ€™t going well for us. Luckily we had train wreck and puppets there!! We would have been screwed without them they were still feeling fine so they worked on getting us a ride out of there. Puppets left his pack and carried ramblings pack to the dirt road where we would be picked up, and train wreck carried his pack and sand witches . What amazing people!! Honestly were so lucky they were there I almost cried multiple times due to their kindness it was beautiful and supper shity at the same time, cause of the shit and vomit ya know?



We limped the mile is to the road letting our bowels evacuate when ever they were going to, not like it was up to us hahaha



Sand Witch thought the whole thing was pretty funny which it was, itâ€™s amazing how she can see the humor in anything!



When we got to the road our ride shortly arrived. Puppets was working on getting us a place to stay and the rest of us were doing our bowl evacuation stuff. Yes sadly train wreck had fallen ill.



We had a twenty minute ride in the back of a pickup on a dirt road. With upset stomachs..... was not fun. But we soon got to a paved road got real car seats cause the trail angles brought a suburban that was parked at the road



I was in the pickup and everyone else was in the suburban. Ramblin was hit the hardest with the virus so she went to the hospital for some fluids and meds. I was the first to the hotel.....Â 



WARNING I TALK ABOUT POOPING MY PANTS UP AHEAD yup feel like Kevin from the office WARNING WARNING WARNINGÂ 



So we pull up to the hotel and I work on bringing everyoneâ€™s backpack to room four. I get two bags in sit down on a bench for a quick break cause I am exhausted. I feel a fart coming..... not thinking about what my body is currently going through I let it pass right on through no security checks or nothing. Well that fart turned into a shart real quick.



So now I have shit in my pants, my idea was to tell Tim (the trail angle driving the pickup) hey uhhhh I just shit my pants and Iâ€™m going to deal with that can you finish loading the bags. BUT the door to room four was locked! Iâ€™ve been foiled!!! I walk to the office to get a key to room four, have to fill out paperwork get the key walk back to talk to Tim but now heâ€™s on the phone!! I try to wave him down to no avail . So I finish in loading the bags walk to Tim tell him thanks you so much I have shit in my pants and need to go.



Iâ€™m in the toilet wiping down when puppets asks me to go to the office to figure out some billing error that happened. I clean (ishÂ ðŸ‘Ž) myself up and get ready to go to the office again but before that happens the smell of my own booty makes me vomit some more. So now I smell like vomit shit and bo am walking outside with a towel on cause I donâ€™t want to spoil my clothes more than I need. When Iâ€™m on the way to the office puppets lets me know he figured it out...... LOL I can go back to my room and shower and actually get clean.Â 



Iâ€™m now actually clean and in bed praying thatâ€™s it for the poo and everything..... nope I wake up in the middle of the night to vomit. While Iâ€™m vomiting my other side doesnâ€™t want to be left out so it pushes some more shit through...... fucking greatÂ ðŸ˜ŠÂ I finally understand coming out both ends. Shower again and wash my underwear again. Get clean then get into bed. Ramblin came in around 3ish from the hospital, puppets was with her all nightÂ ðŸ¥ºÂ heâ€™s seriously an angle of a human!



I was able to slowly drink fluids throughout the night when I would randomly wake up and feel much better now! Thank goodness for the kindness Iâ€™m surrounded by in my trail fam and the kindness of strangers or this might have gone very poorly. Getting so sick your body gets rid of any fluids you put in it in the desert seems hella dangerous.Â
