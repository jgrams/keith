Tonka packed in a watermelon it was the best melon Iâ€™ve ever had. To follow proper leave no trace   I ate the rind. Ramblin was worried the rind was poisoned by nature so when we had service she looked it up. Apparently it actually pretty healthy for you kinda like a cucumber. 8/10 only cause it was a chore eating that rind
