Our plan was to do 20 together. Ramblin and sandy witchy decided to head to town to try to get their second RNA changing shots. I decided to try to get to Kennedy Meadows the next day cause idk why not? Sounds fun? Yup means I should do my first thirty mile day!! Wooo



Plan was to do 27 ish then 31 tomorrow, the camp I was going to stay at was full when I got there at 10 pm (oh well Iâ€™ll just hike two miles to the next spot and get some sleepyhead time....... when I got to that camp and set my stuff up I realized that I would do two 29 mile days and not my first thirty!!! Fam!!! Meant to say dam but that autocorrected to fam, it kinda fits cause maybe this means Iâ€™ll do my first thirty with my trail fam! I wonâ€™t remember crushing miles by myself but I will remember it with amazing people around me! So sweet, holding off on that 30Â ðŸ¤—Â itâ€™s like midnight and sleep time bye yâ€™allÂ
