Zeroed at toluene Meadows definitely not how you spell that also auto correct put it as something else but there’s no editing here so we move on! 



Took a bus down to Yosemite valley and just walked around the paths was really nice even took a “swim” in the river we couldn’t do our laundry’s and take a hiker bath because of all the people. We had to keep it non hiker trash



Bussed back and the “closed” backpacker campground had blown up!!! So many people now when we got there the day before there were like four tents now twenty!!!

Pictures aren’t totally working right now so I’m gonna post this then try to add a picture as an edit wish me luck k goodnight 😘💤🌙😴
