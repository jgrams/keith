much more chill day, wish I could’ve slept more cause i was hungover! I didn’t drink too much but it was close I definitely could have gone without the last three drinks. Which definitely means I drank too much, something to think about next time.

I was hanging on a large patio playing chese with a friend my the trail fam was around talking hanging around there were like twenty hikers just chilaxing dogs were around it was so peaceful perfect and beautiful. Probably the most relaxing part of the trip so far. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again I love it out here this is where I want to be
