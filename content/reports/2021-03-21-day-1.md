Went on a roller coaster of emotions from 8pm yesterday to actually starting trail today. Most of it was high anxiety, terror and dread. The Last night I was sitting in Palm Springs looking at some of the mountain range I’ll pass through in about two weeks thinking there’s no way I can do that.... this feeling of terror eventually left and were replaced by excitement and thrill about this amazing trail I’m trying to do. One day one step at a time
