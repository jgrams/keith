Was hoping the mosquitoes would stay in the Sierras but nooooooooooo they just HAD to follow me!! Guess I got the good good 🩸 blood. That’s a creepy emoji, like the way they shAdow the bottom yikes. But seriously fuck these mosquitoes they are the worst all god fam day.



It rain for a solid couple hours today. Was hoping that would make the mosquitoes run and hid home boy but noooooooooooooooo. I had to deal with the rain and them, it was worse than all the pain. By far the worst part about trail is the mosquitoes. I was flipping them off and cursing at them multiple times through out the day. Like oh yeah they can hear you. Other than that was a good day pretty views lotta lakes 



The tent site I chose and am laying on right now is a little slanted but at least the mosquitoes haven’t figured out how to open my tent . The moment the figure out tent zippers is my last moment outdoors 



Real happy cherry post tonight goodnight 



Totd two people today asked me if they were going the right way towards dicks lake. (I look like I’ve been living in these woods for years so I probably look like a reliable source for directions) I said yeah I think and they kept going. Not twenty feet later I walk by the right path to the lake. I turned and yelled for there attention twice, no more no less, they didn’t answer so I kept going. They were actually going to ducks pass which was a climb hopefully they figured out our mistake and turned around shortly, also totally their fault for missing the trail sign.



I was planning on eating at ducks lake but I didn’t want them to show up and give me the evil 🦹‍♀️ eye so I ate at the next lake
