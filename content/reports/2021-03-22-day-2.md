Ran into some park rangers on trail today their questions about my permits were very rigorous

“Do you have a permit” yes “Did you start in your start day” yes “Do you have a camp stove” yes “Do you have a California fire permit” yes “you have any questions” no “okay have a good day”

Walked about 12 miles today gonna talk it slow for about a week then work to ramp up to 20 miles a day. Spilled some soup on a rock woops don’t think that’s a part of the leave no trace policy.
