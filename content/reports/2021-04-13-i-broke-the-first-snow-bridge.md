So the group I was hiking with saw on gut hooks that there was a small snow bridge (patch of snow that lest you walk over flowing water) coming up. They said I needed to cross it last cause I’m post holing all day and night and will probably make that bridge come crashing down, it was a half joke lol fuck them but it was funny and I also love them!



We get to it, sandwich and stonks are past it. I wait for ramblin to go over it half joking cause there’s no way I’m going to break it. I start crossing over it first couple steps are great ...... then..... boom both feet break through the snow and into the flowing stream! Lol those fucks were right I broke the bridge was hilarious
