description: Tale of the twin trails
---
Saw the trail ahead on the ridge of a mountain, thoughts it would be cool to take a picture looking back at the ridge when I got on the trail in the first picture.... not sure if I explained that right..... imagine a V and I took a picture at the top of each side looking at the other side. That’s what I did, thought it would be cool to look through them and find where I took the picture from but that was to hard so I’m gonna stick with the V analogy.

Thank you have a great night!
