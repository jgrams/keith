title: Day after crater lake….. aka smoke es vile
totd: "TOTD: pretty much this whole trail every time I I would P so people
  behind me wouldn’t see me peeing but keep people coming the other way so
  people going south would see me because that’s the wrong direction and no one
  ever goes south but now every day we’re seeing more and more south founders
  and so I have to pee hiding from both directions hard it’s hard that’s bad
  wording oh wow oh well this text voice to text isn’t going that great done"

OK here we go. Oh shit I just said the word. And I’m gonna restart I’m trying a new thing where I probably should’ve put a comma in there put a comma in there. Anna. Delete Ha shit OK restart I’m trying a new thing where I am going to use voice to text so I can write these journals while I’m walking and hopefully he’ll write them more consistently because the last one I have actually written it was almost a month ago yeah can we go no here we go. This might make it a little harder to understand me because there will be less misspelled words that’s a plus but there might be a lot more random words probably the same amount of random words also very little punctuation even less than before which is small amount amount. I have to say. And, every time I want to. Or, oh wow I didn’t know that didn’t work at all. Huh it keeps like I’m watching it right as I’m talking and it changes it FaceTime when I say afternoon I’m assuming to like make up an actual sentence which I might confuse my phone because my sentences are now full sentences aren’t actual sentences.

A bunch of southbound hikers passed me going south obviously I’m going north if that’s news to you Haven’t been paying attention. They’re all nice. I thought of a joke earlier about it and thought if I started talking about it it would come back to me but I can’t remember it maybe I’ll remember it later OK see you later I am literally there’s no content in this post but it’s really long someone tell me if it’s too long I’m begging you you’re my only hope Obi-Wan.



4:50 PM earlier we went to a Lodge I was hesitant to do because I want to keep walking just wanna walk all the time I’m going to kind of the point where I want this to be over I wanna get to Canada and go home and see my family and start on my life. So I’m hesitant to do side quest anymore I just wanna keep wagon wagon wagon wagon walkingBut we went it was fun I’m glad we did it as always. Now we just climbed up like 1000 2000 1500 feet Now it’s Hella smoky again I’m so grateful my parents sent me masks that’s nice.
