Was gonna start this entry the same way I start many “woke up late” but I’m doing what makes me happy so am I really late? Late for what? There no rules out here about start time haha k



Hiked up a looooooooong climb it wasn’t steep but was over like ten miles.  Definitely rather the steep and short climbs



At the tail end I started to see some sketchy clouds... sure those will just go away...



They did not I got to a beautiful lake at the top for the climb, I WAS SURROUNDED by dark ish clouds (it was kinda like medium rain clouds not like tornado dark clouds so it’ll be fine)



It hailed on me lol wild got past the lake to the top of the pass when it started to thunder. Saw a few flashes of light and just thought well that one missed me HA suck it nature missed me!! 



Made my tent to eat with sandwich out of the rain then keep walking but when we got dry clothes on we decided to stop there lol oh well we’re not late for anything 



Love you 💆‍♂️ goodnight
