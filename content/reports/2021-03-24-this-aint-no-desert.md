## Report for day 4

I thought there wasn’t any water at my next camp site so I carried 5 liters of water with me all day. There was a steam just down the trail and I drank maybe 1 liter all day woops.

Ran into a search and rescue guy setting up some training exercises. He said he was just doing a day hike and didn’t know the area so I told him where I stayed and where water was, then the search and rescue thing came up. It was like that Baby beats computer at chess meme, Google it it’ll make sense.

Got to camp hung out with two people I had met the day before. Was nice to talk to people at camp, they gave me the trail name puzzler I turned it down.

Storm clouds were teasing us all day with just some light raining. Until about 9:30 at night I’m in my tent and it sounds like it’s lightly raining, but the rain sounds a little different then it starts heavy raining so I look outside to see that it’s hail!!!!!! GAAAAH HAIL IN THE DESERT???? Where am I the Arctic lol
