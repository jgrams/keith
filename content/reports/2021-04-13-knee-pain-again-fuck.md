I passed this part at 5am ish... to orient you I was traveling from top to bottom. I stepped with my left foot near the top of the image and I fell through the snow. My car knee (right knee) slammed into two inches of snow and then a rock....... it tucking hurt oh wait no Fucking hurt. I laid there for a bit with severe knee pain till ramblin caught up to me asking if I was okay. I did the normal male bullshit of saying I’m totally fine and keep moving. Also to add the cherry on top when I crawled out of the snow I postholed again lol. I had some bad knee pain for about a mile and though about turning around. I should have, definitely with my car knee problems I should have stopped but I didn’t and now I’m here next time I’ll remember this. My knee isn’t great but it’s not near the trip ending pain I’ve had before. I hope if I take some days off the swelling will go down would be cool. Goodnight love y’all
