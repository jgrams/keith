Richard invited me into his home to take some zeros I was a little hesitant at first but thought why not I’m on an adventure let’s meet new people go to new places. I’m so glad I went Richard and his girlfriend Trish were so welcoming kind and hospitable, I just wish there was more I did for them! It was an amazing way to spend some zeros around knew friends in a new city!!
