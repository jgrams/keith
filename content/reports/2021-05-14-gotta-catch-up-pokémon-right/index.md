Woke up feeling extra tired! So I slept more LOL imma genius



Tim once again gave me a ride so I didn’t have to take the bus!! Thank you so much Tim 🐸



Got to trail around 3 ish had huge plans of hiking 30 miles!!!! Made it like 15 and the wind was kicking my ass so I stopped LOL



As I laid there cow camping I looked at the comments for this tent site. There was much talk of ants. Meh fuck it I’m already here! 



Was nice to camp alone but I’m definitely trying to catch back up with my trail fam
