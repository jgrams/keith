title: KPG on the PCT (and more!)

## ðŸ‘‹Hello!ðŸ‘‹
I'm *Keith*. I'm a **hiker** and I mostly write about my experiences hiking trails like the PCT.

I studied **Electrical Engineering**, then spent years working for *Honda Motors*. My feet got restless, so I walked from Mexico to Canada on the *Pacific Crest Trail* and fell in love and learned a lot about myself. Now I'm working at the amazing *Allen Institute*, I'm also a Search and Rescue volunteer, and work a lot with Raspberry Pi and 3D printing.
