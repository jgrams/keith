Woke up with a thumbs up and smile from Richard. Was nice

We buddied up again to get to Julia like 16 miles away lotta down hill which worried me cause of my car knee. It hurt a little in the beginning of the big down hill, I focused on what my PT told me and I really thought about how I was walking. Made it through doth big down hills of the day with only some pain in the beginning. Was a good day with nice weather, was nice making it to the first town and to take a break before. Richard was kind enough to invite me to his home to take some zeros in San Diego. Gonna hang out there till Monday then itâ€™s back to trail!!

Gonna start to ramp up the miles when I get back!
