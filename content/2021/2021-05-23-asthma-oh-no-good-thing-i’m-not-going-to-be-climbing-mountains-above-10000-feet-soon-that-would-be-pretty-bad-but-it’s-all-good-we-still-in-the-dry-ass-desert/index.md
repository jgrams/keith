Tim and Amy gave us a ride AGAIN!!! They amazing people, was nice to actually talk to them haha and not just vomit near them. Rode with Tim again, he told me all about the town was like getting a tour!!





Was feeling pretty good today did this climb quickly and my asthma was like yo wat up I’m back..... shiiiiit. Spent the next hour or so having a itch/pain in my throat/lungs sweeeeeeeeeeeeeet good thing I’ll be in the hard cold Sierras soon! It’s Sierra but meh who actually cares about that hahaha (I put way to many inside jokes in these, probably alienating the majority of my readers with them)

After I noticed my asthma I went slow for the rest of the day. Also dam it was windy k goodnight I love every person who is reading this. You that mean you!! I love you 🔥!!!!

We found a cool bus near the trail there was other structures and some cars around there too. I think it was from the gold rush area was cool to poke around. Sand Witch was not amused 🙅‍♀️
