Hung out with my old friend cid today, haven’t seen them in a while, was fun!



I was tasked with collecting fire wood. That was it. No other instructions. I collected wood for maybe 15 minutes then got into the hot springs. Lounged around for hours. Around noon cid and I decided to walk up the river and just look around. We hit a huge rock and started climbing. We quickly realized that climbing up was fairly simple but getting back would not be. We climbed up until we found the PCT then walked back to the hot springs to see everyone. By this time the task master himself Tonka was back. He wanted me to collect enough firewood to cook 15lbs of meat and have a bonfire..... I had so failed him. I took a break and redeemed myself in the eyes of Tonka by getting all the wood. I was rewarded with an apple!





So Tonka had spent the last six hours hiking down to town. Going to a Mediterranean market getting. Hummus babushka naan flat bread apples watermelon dates cheese olives 10 pounds of lamb, beef, and rabbit stuff to make guacamole...... no wonder he was so disappointed with the twigs I had collected. But we all got enough wood to cook the food. About 15 of us ate mostly hikers. It was so amazing and communal. Best day on trail best zero Tonka/10 would recommend!!



Thing of the day: Never ever don’t filter your water, that’s just plain dumb.
