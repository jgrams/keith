Went through miles of this. Snow at a slope. It sucked and went on forever at least one hundred miles I donâ€™t need no commas and grammar things LOL sorry friends. I got past the snow took a break and kept going with my knee pain...... it sucked my normal high moral was at a negative I hated everything was blaming everything for my mood and pain I hated life was definitely my lowest moment on trail. I took a break sitting on a rock... would have sat there forever until ramblin and sandwich came by. They stopped sang some theater songs talked and really lifted my spirits ðŸ˜Œwithout them Iâ€™m not sure if I would have made it to camp. I love these people
