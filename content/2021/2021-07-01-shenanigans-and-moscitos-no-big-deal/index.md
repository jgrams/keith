Soccer mom said he was told by a ranger that the campground we stayed at was closed huh people said backpackers had been staying there for week Woops. He camped like four miles back cause of that info



Hung out at the general store for some possible random off trail shinanigans that never happened oh well we can never turn down possible off trail shinanigans. Hiked five miles to a water fall was beautiful k bye goodnightÂ 



Got attacked by the moscitos at the water fall dude these bugs are the absolute WORST
