Starting to write these down offline so it’s more fresh and funky! I am writing this on 4/15 .... meh no buddy’s perfect. Got a ride to trail and breakfast from momma bear!! She’s truly an angle 😊 without angles thru hiking would be so much harder.



Got dropped off at trail and started hiking with a group I already knew. Dirtnap gourmet and max good people. Hiked to a creek took a break and a toke of some clove cigarette. The toke was a mistake, I layed around for hours lol. I was around a bunch of people I didn’t know so I was pretending to be asleep to be left alone..... it didn’t work. Someone asked me if a trash bag was mine. I was frozen lol she said “I’m not sure if he’s awake I can’t see with the glasses he’s wearing” god I hope she didn’t know I was just looking at her and just ignoring her hahahaha oh well.



We hiked another two miles made camp then slept. I left my gps pinging all night woops
