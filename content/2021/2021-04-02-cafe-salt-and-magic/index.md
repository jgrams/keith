"Woke up without any water, and cause I’m a smarty pants dinner for the last night I ate the world saltiest meal EVER so I was pretty thirsty. Only two miles to my next water!!

Got a snickers ice cream bar from some amazing trail angles. Was the best ice cream I’ve ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Lotta uphills to get to paradise valley cafe. Some say it’s the best burger on trail!! Meh but that’s on me I shouldn’t have ordered the Texas toast bun, that thing got wet and fell apart. The company and beer was top notch though 10/10 would recommend


Also pooed into a toilet. 19/10 would recommend "
