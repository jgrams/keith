Woke up this morning at some sort of hiker commune. It. Was. AMAZING!!! I helped the grounds keeper “Spirit” cut stuff for his new roofing, and move a fence over. Gave him about three hours of work for letting me and some other people stay the night there and feed us! He offered me some smelly plant as payment, I declined. Over all mikes place was amazing and I’m so glad I stopped there! I want to stop at all these weird trail side places meet all the interesting people, from six feet away and outside..... yeah.

I left spirit at mikes place around noon and only planed on doing 10 ish miles but when I got to the camp I was going to stay at the sun got blocked by some clouds making it way cooler! So I hiked on until sundown! Saw my first sun set on trail I can’t  even describe how I felt, it was perfect I almost cried at the beauty this is exactly where I want to be in life right now. This is amazing
