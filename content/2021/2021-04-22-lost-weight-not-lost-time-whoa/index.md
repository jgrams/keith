Long hiking today, lotta up hill ..... I loved it. I love uphill hate downhill. Also crisscrossed a stream all day, got lost a few times. Was amazing carried 1 liter All day. Walked through a forest fire area was wild to see these huuuuge trees charred and fallen. Camping near new people, trying to pick up my pace to catch back up with the San jacinto crew but also who else is out there to meet???? Many people. Iâ€™m a philosophical person night night



Oh also I ate like FIVE times today!!!! I was so hungry and kinda tired wonder if it has to do with the vaccine? Definitely not that Iâ€™m not eating enough, oh I started at 225 lbs and am down to 205 lbs ...... definitely the vaccineÂ 

Saw a shooting star
