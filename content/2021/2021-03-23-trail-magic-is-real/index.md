Made it to my fist town just stopped into get some sunscreen trash bags trash bags. At the campsite  There were a bunch of RVâ€™s packing up and one couple was yelling at each other, glad I slept in the woods (definitely closer to desert out here but you get it).

Talked with a father son duo Junji and Junji the father went by John to avoid confusion. They were the first people I really talked to on trail.

Walked through a campground with some set up trail magic in it!!!! I grabbed a clementines and some water and kept going.

Recently got to camp around 3pm, I so want to keep hiking but need to hold it back for the first week!
