I‚Äôve been spelling sand witches name wrong and from everyone at Keith gramila dot com from the bottom of our hearts we apologize. We can‚Äôt promise it won‚Äôt happen again cause the main writer can barely spell his own name and the editors are waaaay under paid but we will do our best? Some emoji ü¶Å this emoji reminds me of when I face time my mom and she uses that filter! It‚Äôs fun. This post has gone off the rails like most of them so bye



Sorry the one the only sand Witch!
