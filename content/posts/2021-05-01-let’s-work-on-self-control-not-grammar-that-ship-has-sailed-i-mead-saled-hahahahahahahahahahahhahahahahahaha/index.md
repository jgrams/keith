Planned on hiking close to big Agnes the town that I pronounce in the most wrong way possible. We meet near the Akton KOA decided to go in to re up on some water. That quickly turned into camping there. There were a bunch of other hikers there. We drank a bit, I think I drank too much would like to work on self control while I’m out here. I have very little self control? I was quite loud and slightly embarrassed in the AM sorry hikers my bad. Love y’all 



How do I work on self control? How do I get more? Do things not to excess? Like not walking from Mexico to Canada that seems excessive 👍 



Totd: poured water out of a thing into my thing then Drank it. Was a slow news day
