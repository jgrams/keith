Night hiked along the LA aqueduct! It was an experience for sure haha we brought glow sticks and techno music had a little personal rave! 



My old bosses Jeremy and Aaron would tease me for going to raves and I imagine this personal rave is they were making fun of, like six people spinning glow sticks for hours. It was nice  to BS with my Honda people I miss those days, was fun



We saw some wild lights in the sky all perfectly in a row moving across the night sky. Was amazing and magical “could it be aliens???” Nah it’s just Elon musk and his bullshit filling up the night sky. Satellite WiFi fuck yeah, having to look at Leon’s bull every night nope
