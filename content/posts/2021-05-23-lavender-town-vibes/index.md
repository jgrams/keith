Hitched into town, was an interesting hitch this is an interesting town for sure has a vibe. We resupplied and cleaned our water cleaner and carriers.

Heard a funny convo at the grocery between a grandson and grandmother 



Gs why are we going down this lane

Gm I’m getting Pepsi 

Gs you know momma said no Pepsi 



I laughed it might not translate as well to text but there it is



Watched olar opposites, a Rick and Morty like  show on Hulu was hilarious!
