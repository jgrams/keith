Walked up a place called tinkers knob in r something like that on the way to it there was no one else but other pct-ers. At the top and on the way back down was FULL of day hikers. Nothing against them but you know. Got some trail magic once I got close to the trailhead/parking lot. Also got more in the parking lot. Day hikers love giving out trail magic. And I love them. 

\
The parking lot is close to where the douner party did the thing (I asked Casey how to spell douner while typing this and sheâ€™s laughing at how I spelled it so it must be right). 



Thereâ€™s a douner ski ranch and a bunch of other douner themed stuff in the area. Thought it was a little messed up cause those people ate each other to live and here we are making t shirts with their name yikes ðŸ˜¬ 



Well the douner ski ranch gives out a 40 oz beer to thru hikers. Casey and I got ours and they were steel reserve!!! Yikes they are like 8% n we drank one and gave the other one away.

\
Made it only a few more miles after the reserve before making camp and sleeping ðŸ˜´ goodnight 



We also camped near a rest stop, I try to pack out the trash I find on trail but there was too much there I left it. Boom humble brag
