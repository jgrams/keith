Our plan was to do ten miles lol we never follow through. But we do what we want so cool! Also was my idea to stop early Lol 



Since we were doing small miles we hung out at camp till like noon!!! Wooooooo late start is a Keith approved start. Hiked through gorgeous trees mountains rocks all of it was beautiful fuck the desert ! Hiked till we got to the first water source theeeeeeeen stopped for the day woops haha oh well we gotta go slow so we can go to Vegas on the 28th from lone pine a town like 30 miles away. So we gotta average less than 10 miles a day. Everyone set up their tents and I just cow camped under the stars. Hopefully being next to this river won’t be an issue in the morning with condensation and things!

Also ran into that random guy again. He was pleasant maybe he was just having a bad day? Oh well who cares
