The past 24 hours were a roller coaster of emotions. Mostly dread and terror. Spent the night before getting on trail looking at the mountain range near Palm Springs thinking there’s no way I can do this. Getting closer to the southern terminus those feelings were replaced with joy and excitement! One day and one step at a time I’ll get past the Sierra Mountains near Palms Springs
