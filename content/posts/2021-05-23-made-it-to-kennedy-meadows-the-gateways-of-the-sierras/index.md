Woke up late. No surprise from anyone there lol 



Got hiking around 830?



Hiked fast to get to k meds before dark. Took a couple breaks to eat and filter water feeling great till the end of the last climb! Then I felt sluggish lol only 15 miles to go!!



At the bottom of the descent I took a dinner break to reset my mood and let my body rest. Was well worth the time I hiked the last 10 miles quickly with a dude named poppa JR he’s good people, so is everyone I talk about on this website and most of the people out here. They’re not all gonna be winners someone shit gonna get though the pct 



Pops and i flew to town. We got clapped into town and stayed at the general store with some other hikers



Some guy had a guitar and sang some songs before bed was exactly what you imagine nights around a camp fire on a thru hike are was so peaceful 

Bed



No picture today I was to busy walking
