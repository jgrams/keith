Yesterday I washed my AirPods in my sweatpants pocket lol darn!!! at first the right noise canceling didn’t work it’s been slowly getting better. Hopefully They are fine idk

im still a little sick but doing way better! Glad I could sleep as much as I did before going to vantage this weekend for my first real rock climbing adventure!! Excited to take what I’m learning to some alpine rock climbing 🧗‍♂️
