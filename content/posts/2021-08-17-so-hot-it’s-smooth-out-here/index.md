Guess what.... it’s hot again and our hotel didn’t have any ac!!!! But other than that the hotel was very cute! If you’re ever in Sierra city stay in the Sierra motel with Robert!! He’s a very interesting character and fun to talk with 🧙



Had to say goodbye to a good friend someone we hiked with for a while smoooooooth he got off trail and is going Europe for a bit!! Peace out man see you in the future love youuuuuuuuuuuuu (enter picture of smooth here)

Smooth at Kennedy Meadows that last place I saw him before Sierra city almost 600 miles ago





It was so hot 🥵 and we had a huge climb out of Sierra city so we did it at night time. Started at five.



Hung out playing pool for a few hours then hit the road. Hiked up a hill/mountain idk 🤷‍♀️ got to camp around midnight?



Saw some eyes during the night hike pretty sure they were dear cause the eyes we silver or something but BOTH Casey and ramblin saw green eyes like a big ol cat!!!! Scary stuff
