title: How wet and cold? Figured it out!
totd: "Totd: it was cold don‚Äôt hike into a storm without the right gear it‚Äôs
  dangerous. I would be lying if I wasn‚Äôt scared a couple of times but the
  thought of maybe dying never crossed my mind. I was surrounded by people who
  love me and have an emergency button strapped to my chest. K love you"

Yikes mom and dad not going to love this story but it‚Äôs what happened! Love you and remember I have an emergency button.



SO

Day started in a warm hotel, woke up late (as usual) so I rushed to make the breakfast bus to an amazing bakery in stihekin wa (spelling is hard)



I should go back a little to add some background to this story, cause my last post was so long ago y‚Äôall ain‚Äôt got no clue what‚Äôs going on with me. All you know is I‚Äôm a dot moving along a map.



SO

Walking into stihekin we kept hearing about a horrible storm coming (heard Facebook was full of people saying ALL PCT HIKERS MUST GET OFF TRAIL FOR THE SEASON aight. We figured we will get internet look for ourselves and figure out what to do from there. Also heard about this amazing bakery 

Okay y‚Äôall all caught up



So back to the hotel. I‚Äôm packing rushing to catch the bus back to the bakery make it to the bus barely on time but it‚Äôs full GAHHHH üßê heard the bus will be back but that meant I had an extra 10 minutes to pack! The room was locked and keys were dropped of so no going back. Sitting and waiting for the bus I realized I left my buff in the hotel (like neck warmer thing) DARN gonna be cold today would‚Äôve been nice to have that oh well I‚Äôll survive. 

Get on the bus and half way to the bakery and realize I left my critical role hat in the hotel!!!!!! NOOOO NOT MY VANITY HAT!!!!! Honestly was most bummed about leaving that behind. Okay thought I‚Äôll just have my pops call them and get the hotel to ship it home. Was really bummed because I took a picture of that hat in the beginning and was going to take one at the end in 80 MILES!!! So close!!!

Oh well I‚Äôll be fine



After getting food from the bakery and while waiting for the bus to take us back to the PCT I realized I left my rain kilt in the room ü•∂ yikes that‚Äôs a big one. Supposed to rain for a few days gonna be cold I would really love to try to keep my legs dry and warm. Oh well I‚Äôm a pretty warm person I‚Äôll probably be fine. 

\
Puppets had the idea to satellite messages someone back in town and ask them to bring it to trail. But I‚Äôm the mean time I had to walk without my rain kilt buff and vanity hat in the rain! At the time I was most bummed about the hat , cause you know I‚Äôll be fine without the gear I run warm!!



We start hiking and it‚Äôs fine not raining that much I‚Äôm pretty warm even though I‚Äôm wearing shorts ü©≥ do have a long sleeve shirt and rain coat on though so that was nice. We get about 10 miles in and I start to get REALLY COLD ü•∂ COLD ü•∂ 

my hands start like not working I think huh if my hands don‚Äôt work how do I set up my tent‚Ä¶ .. (five dots means don‚Äôt make me say what I‚Äôm about to say cause it would blow your mind! According to Kelly capoor 



Luckily, well not luckily we knew this was an option and factored that into our decision to hike out into a storm, there was a road in ten more miles that we could take into a town and get a hotel. 

So we decided to not make camp get dry and get into our sleeping bags instead push the miles and get into town. I was walking behind the one and only lovely Casey O. And there were a few times where her legs looked like they were melding together. Also I stopped to do something so I was alone started walking and got confused if I was going the right way north or south. I eventually caught up with Casey so I was going the right way but there was this fog over my mind for a while. 



After a couple miles it stopped raining and I warmed up so it got much better but still scary. It also started again near the end which sucked again. 



SO

we got to the road there was this car waiting in the parking lot waiting for someone. They let us get warm in their car and gave us a ride into town!!! Thank you so much kristy!!!! You‚Äôre a life savor (maybe actually) we got into town into a hotel. Got a hot meal, warm dry clothes on and felt way better!

I meant to get a picture of me to show you how cold and wet I could get but when we got to the road I could only think of getting warm so here is one of the few pictures I took that day. 







I can get pretty cold and wet and I think I figured out that line lol
