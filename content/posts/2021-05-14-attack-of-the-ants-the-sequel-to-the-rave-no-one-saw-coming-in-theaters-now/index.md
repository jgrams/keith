Last night we didnâ€™t quite make it to the bridge we wanted to go to so we had a couple miles to do in the am. Then sleep in the shade and night hike again!!

Buuuuuut before any of that when I woke up there were a bunch of ants on my food bag. I gave it a good toss to get the ants off. After the toss I noticed the bottom of the bag was wet.sweeeeeeeetÂ ðŸ‘¾(what even is that emoji? Like space invaders but different?) started going though the bag and there was melted chocolate EVERYWHERE okay not everywhere but in some places. A chocolate bar melted so.

Dealt with that then hiked to the bridge where we napped till five ish, ate then started hiking at six!

Walked through a wind farm! I touched one!!! Was really cool

Didnâ€™t go as far as we wanted lol night hiking is quite sleepy inducingÂ ðŸ”¦ðŸ§¸ðŸ›Œ
