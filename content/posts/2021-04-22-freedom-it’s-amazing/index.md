Walked most of the day alone and had this overwhelming sense of freedom at the end of the day. I am free to do anything with my time it’s a nice feeling. 



Sped past the town big bear lake, I don’t need more food and things. I did run out of lunches today (I don’t cook for lunch so I usually eat a bunch of granola and cold meat) so I’m starting to cold soak...... TORTELLINI!!!! Of course!! for tomorrow at lunch will let you know how it goes but I’m thinking I started the soak a couple hours early lol not sure it needs like 18 hours. But back to it don’t need anything from big bear.



Rolled into camp at 8ish (more like hiked in hahahahahahajahaha) there’s one other tent here feel creepy walking around their tent looking for a flat site at dark. Oh well nothing else I can do.



Thing of the day: I keep getting a zit in the same spot on my nose, I pop it like once every few days. Today I popped it and thought why is this thing keep coming back I normally don’t have this constant of acne.... oh I’m showering once a week now. Now I wonder why it’s not worse, maybe the sun? Well there it is the thought of the day.
