Hung out at the general store making friends saw smooth again!! Was nice to see him again lol itâ€™s nice to see everyone again



Headed to grumpies bar to drink. Thereâ€™s a fude between the two stores that kinda sucks but oh well Iâ€™m just passing on through. Sand Witch ramblin puppets and train wreck caught up!!!!! Yus!! Also saw a new guy named Stiltsâ€™s, we met him at the cabin but he heard of the noro virus so he kept his distance. This time he gave me the best hug!!!! Weâ€™re the same night meaning we could put our heads on each otherâ€™s shoulder was really niceÂ ðŸ¥°Â
