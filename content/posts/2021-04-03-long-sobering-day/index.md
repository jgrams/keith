First half of the day was uneventful, just a lot a walking.... Around lunch I made it to this beautiful area called cedar spring it was this tiny oasis full of cedar trees with amazing campsites. I talked with a couple on a day hike while I was re filling my water. We talked about the PCT and how it‚Äôs going. They said something at the end like ‚Äúwith a smile like that when you talk about it you must be loving it‚Äù something along those lines. It really touched me ü•∞ (oh dam just realized I can put emojis in here ü•≥)

More walking

I started getting to higher elevations and snow started popping up. Walked over one section that was sloped and snowy that was a little sketchy took my time planting each foot.

Then I got to the area where someone died last year. Two hikers that I knew were turning around from it and gave me solid advice ‚Äúcheck it out but don‚Äôt do it alone.‚Äù I looked at the section, covered in snow, for maybe ten minutes thinking about going or not going and all that I thought ‚Äúmy parents would be so mad if they knew I tried that‚Äù so I texted them that I was turning around and that I loved them.

Soooooo I turned around at 5:00 ish had a six mile hike down to a road where I wanted to hitch into idyllylylylywild. I made it down the spitler trail to a road right as the sun went down. Started walking the ten miles to idyllwild as it‚Äôs getting darker and darker. No one is driving down this road, I‚Äôm starting to look for campsite along the road. Eventually I walk by the family on vacation packing up on the side of the road, they might have watched the sunset not sure, i ask them how do you get to idyllwild, they tell me I say oh thank you I‚Äôm trying to hitch there...... and start slowly waking away. They talked to each other in Spanish and asked if I wanted a ride, was amazing

They gave me a ride to the campsite in idyllwild where I was planning on staying... it was full. Someone in the same situation as me got dropped off from a hitch. Me and the other hitch hiker...... I just got that!!!! HIKER!!!! Ooooooohhhhh. So me and the other hiker named red start looking for a hotel together cause we‚Äôve known each other for all of five minutes. I call the silver pine lodge to see if they have any availability‚Äôs the woman there Chris says no but she will call around to see if anyone does! Whaaaaat that‚Äôs amazing. Red gives me half his sandwich as we wait for Chris to call me back. She calls saying she has a hotel about a mile away with vacancy and she will give us a ride there!!! People are amazing

That‚Äôs all
