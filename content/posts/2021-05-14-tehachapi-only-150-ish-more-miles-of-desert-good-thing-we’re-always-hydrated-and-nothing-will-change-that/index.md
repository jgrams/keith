Woke up to a beautiful rendition of the world famous cardi b song if it’s up it’s stuck. Better than coffee at getting you going on the road.



Made it up a climb to a “snack bar” more like five chairs covered in ants!!!! But there was a water cache soooooo it’s cool. Got the Keith granola dot com approval.



We made it into town to tttchhchchhheeppsss! Me puppets ramblin sandwich and Trainwrek! They went back to trail and I didn’t join them, honestly I wanted a break from them. I really enjoy their company and love traveling with them but sometimes you just wanna get away ya know? I’m assuming some of them are reading this love y’all. This goes back to that totd, do I change what I write cause they’re reading it? I don’t think so.



I hung out with goodwill fluff just will and bear. Enjoyed their company for a bit too bad they’re going way too fast and I’ll never see them again FORESHADOWED GET FORESHADOWED CAUSE IM WRITING THIS ALMOST A SOLID WEEK LATER



Went to dinner with smooth Poppins diamond aaaaaaand Tim. Tim’s trail name is Lux cause he carried a cot a chair and some other luxury items! He got off trail cause he wanted to do other stuff! More power to you Lux!!
