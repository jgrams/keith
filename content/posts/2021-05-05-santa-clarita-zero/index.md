Jordan drove us around to resupply and things. All the driving was a lot, more thinking about my accident? I wonder why? I wasn’t thinking about it while I was driving as much before I left Columbus, maybe I’m not used to going so fast! Vroom vroom



We went to a Sally’s beauty for hair things. THE one THE only THE Sand Witch bleached and dyed my hair pink!!! Was a lot of fun and some burning getting it dyed. Pink out of 10 would recommend 



Was an amazing zero so glad I came along



Totd: my pink hair DUH
