Started the day in Lake Tahoe pretty city buuuuut gotta get out of here before the fourth things start happening. Staying here another night is twice as expensive as it was last night.

Did chores

Went to a bagels shop and was recognized by some people as PCT hikers chatted for a minute then sat down to eat. When they were leaving the offered us a ride back to the trail head (SCORE!)Â Â theyâ€™re an amazing couple thatâ€™s traveling the country together living on the road in air bb and things! Seems like the life to just adventure with your significant other, it is rather amazing.



Theyâ€™re awesome people and I hope them the best!



Hiked to aloha lake, was PACKED the PCT is following the Tahoe rim trail so itâ€™s kinda like the Sierras and the John Muir trail again, all these new peopleÂ ðŸ¤“thaaaaaaat Iâ€™m never gonna see againÂ ðŸ˜”

The lake was beautifulÂ ðŸ¤©Â
