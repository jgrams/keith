Casey and I have been fighting carpet Beatles for about a month. We hoped they were flying in through the window but today I saw some larvas on the floor next to our dishwaser!!!!! I'm gonna get some diatemithious earth and boric acid today and go to town.



This weeked was good, sleeping alone will take some getting used to but oh well. Slept on the couch for a bit last night then moved to the bed. washed the sheet and duvet cover but didnt get to the part where I put them back so i slept without them lol



Things are well, started therapy and this week im focusing on contorling the things I can and being emotionaly okay with the things that I can't.



Went on a hike on sunday to get back into shape. My knees have been bothering me for a couple months now. I think the rest stage of healing my knees is over and I can get back to walking more. excited to run to carkreek park and pack raft back !!!
