Spotify decided to delete all my downloaded things again so more self reflection! I should probably do that more as a activity out here and not just when I have nothing to listen to(besides nature YUK ... lolol jkjk kinda but the fuck Spotify) if anyone reading this works for Spotify please reach out ASAP. How are you gonna reach out? Idk you’re the genius at Spotify you figure that out. Not a lot happened today just a lot of walking 🚶‍♀️ actually writing this one the night of so that’s good.
