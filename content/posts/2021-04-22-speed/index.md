miles: 259.4
title: Speed
breakfast: Oatmeal and nuts
lunch: nuts granola and a packet of tuna allot of assorted nuts
dinner: tortellini (of course) with buttered noodles all boiled in milk LOL was
  some cream soup with some crunch at the end cause I can’t figure out when to
  add the tortellini. Added some spam to the final product. Decided to slid it
  right out of the packet for added flare
