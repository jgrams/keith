Uhhhhh I got way behind on posting so Iâ€™m just gonna jump to present day well yester present day



Walked through tunnel falls yesterday (for those keeping track of time thatâ€™s two yesterdayâ€™s from now today so)

Walked through tunnel falls yesterday getting into town today, itâ€™s a big tourist attraction so there are soooooooooo many day hikers ðŸ‘‹ had to stop to let them pass every few minutes! Got a touch annoying but itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s nature and I donâ€™t own it love seeing people enjoying it (except for the people that leave trash in nature those people suck, this section of trail was the grossest Iâ€™ve seen yet!)



Uhhhhh lotta day hikers made it very hard to pee and poo in the woods so I walked fast to a porta potty in the parking lot. After the parking lot Casey and I walked into cascade locks!! PCT trail days!! Thereâ€™s a bunch of people with COVID here so letâ€™s avoid people ha dam kinda sucks that thing is back. Good thing Iâ€™m vaccinated!!! Suck it COVID!

Masks on, outside stuff, we were there for a bit. Trail days is kinda like a farmerâ€™s market but instead of farms there gear companies, and a couple farms!!!! Ha was nice seeing some old friends ðŸ˜€



Casey and I stayed in a hotel! K goodnight 





Sooo I skipped like a month so hereâ€™s a recap. Maybe Iâ€™ll go back and write these posts but idk I gotta do that for the Sierras too 



* Casey and I are dating! Makes me so happy been going on for a while donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve explicitly said it on here but there were definitely some signs
* saw a poo on trail! Yuck!! The section from timberline lodge to cascade locks was the dirtiest section Iâ€™ve seen. Toilet paper everywhere and saw one pair of boxers (most definitely with poo in them) and a literal human poo!!!!!!!! Ugh oh warning I talk about poo back thereâ€¦.. if you like to read out of order that warning was for you if not sorry
* skipped like 200 miles of Oregon. The smoke was too much!! Also part of the trail is closed due to a fire from a 2019 or 2020 fire. Hopefully we can do a road trip after Canada to finish that part
* ramblin is back again she bounces in and out itâ€™s a real roller Costner of emotions and walking 
* Other stuff? Yeah definitely a lot of other
