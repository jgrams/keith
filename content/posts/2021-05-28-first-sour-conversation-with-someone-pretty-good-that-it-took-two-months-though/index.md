Went back to Kennedy Meadows to pick up asthma things and get back to trail!!

Got a ride from TyeDye probably not how you spell that but you know. We talked cars and things was fun! I say that a lot in here my trail fam says I drop nouns and things from sentences I see it.Â Â Uhhhh yeah cars I downloaded car talk cause.



Had my first bad conversation out here well first bad conversation that I was the main talker



I was trying to get a package and this guy comes up random guy, little spoonÂ ðŸ¥„Â (thatâ€™s meeeeeee)



Rg you could just wait a day and your package will be here

Ls Iâ€™m trying to get out to trail today

Rg how many miles you doing (weird thing to transition to but okay someone obviously wants to talk about how fast theyâ€™re going)

Ls like 15

Rg thatâ€™s not enough

Ls smiles not miles haha

Rg that works on the AT not out here

Ls meh (i donâ€™t remember the whole convo this is just paraphrase and I probably make myself sound better but Iâ€™m trying to be as close to the truth as I can)

Rg Iâ€™ll be waving to you from Canada

Ls last one to Canada wins

Rg (something about how itâ€™s a race idk exactly)

Ls aight guess weâ€™re in different races ha

Convo pretty much ended there, lol the fuck dude? imma do me you do you and I donâ€™t care. Well I care a bit or I wouldnâ€™t be writing this I also thought about it for a while afterwards.
