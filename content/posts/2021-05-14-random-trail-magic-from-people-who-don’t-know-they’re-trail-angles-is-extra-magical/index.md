Woke up to do a 16 mile day not to bad! Took an amazing break on a wild rock train wreck had found.



Hiked along to a stream where we ran into goodwill again!!! Woop woop how did we catch up with the speed master himself.... he was sick......FOREsSHAWOD you know the rest him roadrunner and fluff werenâ€™t feeling too well. Luckily they were able to get a ride off trail from someone hiking the trail on a horse. Thereâ€™s a word for that but if I looked it up all my true fans would be like bullisht he knows horse words!!! Itâ€™s tarnish everything Iâ€™ve built.Â 



I made it to the campsite and there were two cars. I went over to see whatâ€™s up and there was a fellow Columbus man named Doug and his friend rich!



They gave me beer and we hung out till my trail fam started looking for me. Then they gave all of us beer and food!!! Was amazing first trail magic in a whileÂ ðŸ¥³Â theyâ€™re great people
