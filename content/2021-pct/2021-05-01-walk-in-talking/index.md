Walked. Had phone service part of the day got to call my parents was niceÂ ðŸ§¸Â ( talk about my emoji choices way too much I gotta keep them on point, will actually thinking about them now instead of randomly choosing the first one I think fits change that? Oh Jerez! ) slept at a ranger station and hung out till after dark. Was nice to hang out with my trail famÂ ðŸŽ‰



Totd: walked under some high voltage power lines today while I had both head phones in (itâ€™s good if thereâ€™s a rattle snake near so I donâ€™t hear it coming) heard some snapping and cracking thought my head phones were exploding. Was weird, took a video



Totd2: got a snickers from some day hiker trail angles today. I havenâ€™t eaten a snickers in years, the taste reminded me of Halloween as a kidÂ ðŸ‘¦Â thanks mom and dad for giving me these happy memories I love you bothÂ ðŸ«€
