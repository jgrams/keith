Wore long pants and a short sleeve shirt. Was constantly putting on sun screen and still got burnt. Will be wearing a long sleeve shirt tomorrow.

Past 100 miles today!!! Woooo only 26 more times hahahahaa

A lot of today was through plains where a bunch of cows were grazing. Offered no shelter from the sun but was just as beautiful as the mountains just in a different way.

Did like 16 miles today almost went for 23 miles but still gotta ease into it!
Still no blisters! Met someone who is at blister number seven!! Yikes
