Found another toilet today. It was amazing snagged some more toilet paper cause I was running low. Reminded me of me and Dan A stealing those huge roles from the engineering building in college. Please don’t report me I don’t want to go to jail. K thanks





Lotta breaks today and still solid miles I loved it. We made it to Cajon pass where we were planning on re supply ing then back to trail to camp. We resupplied saw some meh clouds and decidedly stay in a hotel. Was an the right decision cause fuck you wind!!



Thing of the day: I’ve been size 36 or up pants since like high school. My size 36 hiking pants are becoming too small and are starting to fall down as I walk. 

Edit: yes it’s the pants that are too small that’s why they’re falling down not my hips!
