Stayed at the best lake we’ve seen yet!! Was so beautiful and had a sandy beach around it perfect for some on trail relaxation!!! (Most of the trail is relaxing so that doesn’t mean that much but it is amazing. I guess actually the Sierras are real hard so that relaxation is important!!! It’s always up or down out here never easy flat know what I’m saying? Also fucking miscitos not how you spell that oh well. They’re the little flying blood suckers from hell if that word is hard to figure out.



Didn’t start hiking till 930 woops and with beach time was hard to get that 17 mile day in but hiked till 8ish and got it done woop woop here we goooooo
