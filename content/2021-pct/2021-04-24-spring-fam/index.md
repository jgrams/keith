Hung out at the hot springs for half the day was nice to chill with tonka and friends for some time.

I think I found my people to hike the trail with!! Really love their energy and humor. I’m excited to move towards Canada with them!! Woop woop. Done.

Enjoy the picture of horses cause I didn’t take many photos this day

Thing of the day: the realm of endless possibilities is always there but people rarely reach for it. Paraphrased tonka quote
