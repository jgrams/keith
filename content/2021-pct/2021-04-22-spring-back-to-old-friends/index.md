Long good day. Woke up pretty late started hiking around ten. I want to start hiking earlier so I can take long breaks through out the day. Means I have to wake up early soooooooooo .

Â Met back up with stonks before I even started hiking. He said he saw someone going into a pit toilet with a womanâ€™s sun hat on and was pretty sure that was me. Hiked all day listening to podcasts and music. Knee doing pretty well even with the downhill, thank goodness for the knee brace I got thanks to Mr Schmidtâ€™s suggestion. Also my left hip if flaring up again woo!!! At least itâ€™s not both at the same time. When one gets better the other gets worse yin and yang? I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s yang or yan



Caught up with sandwich and ramblin right before we reached the hot springs!!!!! Itâ€™s nice to see everyone againÂ ðŸ¥³Â jukebox was leading yoga when we got there but they were just beginning shavasinya ( totally spelled that right) when we got thereÂ ðŸ˜­real roller coaster of emotions. Hung out in the spring with a bunch of hikers then bed

Thing of the day: cold soaked tortellini is real bad
