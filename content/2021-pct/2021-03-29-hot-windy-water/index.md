Woke up in a bed this morning! After two days of zeros and hanging around Richard and Trish's house in San Diego it was time to get back to trail. Richard was kind enough to give me a ride and even take me to Julian for some odd and ends!

Felt fresh and ready to go when I got to trail, for the most part I still do! Today hiking was mostly along the side of a couple mountains there were so many spots for amazing panoramic photos I took six! Lol 

Was a hot day, Thursday through Sunday will be even hotter. Hoping to be higher up and in more vegetation than I am now before that hits. My right ankle was the only part of me that was sore for most of the day. I should add it to my post hike stretches 

It was also very windy around some corners.... thatâ€™s where the title comes from
