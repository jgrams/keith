Climbed to like 10600 feet!! I thinks itâ€™s the highest weâ€™ve been! I also went number two up there tallest pooÂ ðŸ’©Iâ€™ve taken yet. Hiked down through beautiful trees and things almost cried it was so perfect. Camped, smoked some clove cigs again then bed slow day but another great day I love it
